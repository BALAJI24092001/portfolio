## Commands

### Install:<br>

`winget install git`

### Set up:<br>

- `git config --global user.name "User Name"` <br>
- `git config --global user.email "email@email.com"`

### Create a New Project:<br>

- `mkdir project`<br>
- `cd project`<br>
- `git init` _(initialise empty git repo in my folder (based on path) aka .git folder)_ <br>
- `ls -la` _(check my folder)_

### Check "world status":<br>

`git status`

### Help for each command

`git help <command>`

### Add files

- `git add .` = add all on current branch
- `git add -p <param=file>` = add part of file to staging area, ask for each change (if no param => all files) so we have more control and cleaner commits.
  _After any `git add`, we need a `git commit`, either a file or a pattern (e.g. `_.txt`)<br>\*

### Delete a file

- `git rm <filename>` = deletes a file, updates git and then commit!<br>
- `git rm --cached <filename>"` = delete a previously tracked file

### Move a file

`git mv <old path> <new path>` _should be followed by:_<br>
`git rm <old path>`<br>
`git add <new path>`

### Check difference

- `git diff`= displays what will be added if i `git add`, so what changed in the folder and hasn't been updated yet
- `git diff <filename>` = displays the alterations of a file (the modified and the commited versions of it)
- `git diff --staged` = displays what has already been added and thus what changed will be recorded
- `git diff HEAD` = displays changes since last commit

### Display history

`git-log` = displays the history, the chronologival order of commits (based on their IDs), who did them, what was their description<br>
`git show <id>` = displays what the <id> commit did = `git log` + `git diff`

### Make an [alias](https://medium.com/the-lazy-developer/five-life-changing-git-aliases-e4211c090017)

- `git config --global alias.<aliasname> "command(s)"`
  <br>e.g.:<br>
  `git config --global alias.lg "log --color --graph --pretty=format: '%(red%h%(green(%cr)%((bold blue)<%an>%(reset' --abbrev -commit"`
- `git config --list` - displays our aliases

### Make archive

`git archive --format=zip -o latest.zip HEAD`

### Revert to old commit

`git log`<br>
`git checkout <commit hex id>`

### Cancel not staged changes

`git checkout` = it copies staging area (usually last commit) to out working copy

### Reset

`git reset` - remove all that exists in my staging area by copying them from the most recent commit (basically undoes `git add`)

### Copy a commit to another branch

`git cherry-pick <commit>` = we copy a commit from a point of the graph, we put it on active branch (therefore creating a copy of the selected commit) - new ID, same changes and description!

### Copy changes to new commit$

`git revert <commit>` = inverted add/deletes etc. It cancels the commit that has already happened.

### Tags

- `git tag -a <tag>` = adds tag to last commit of current branch
- `git tag -a <tag> <commit>` = add tag to selected commit
- `git tag` = shows all tags in repo
- `git tag -d <tag>` = deletes a tag

### Publish tags

`git push <remote> <tag>` = publishes tag in remote
`git fetch --tags <remote>` = brings all tags from remote

### Serial list of changes

- `git reflog` = all the changes
- `git reflog <branch>` = changes on our branch
- `git reflog --date=relative` = displays changes relative to time

### Prune stale references

- `git fetch -p`

# Questions

## How many `git add <filename>` do I need?

| Times | What it does                                                                |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Tracks `<filename>`                                                         |
| 2     | Makes `<filename>` staged                                                   |
| 3     | If modified again after staged, we need a thrid `git add` to stage it again |

## What does `git commit` do?

- commit a file = create a snapshot of the current world state (files, folders & their contents)
- contains an explanatory message
- automatically stores metadata (creator, date etc)
- has a unique (hex) id number
  <br> _e.g.: `git commit -m "Added README file`_

## Combinations

- `git commit -a` = `git add` + `git commit` (not desirable due to lack of control)
- `git pull` = `git fetch` + `git merge` (very useful)

## What is a branch?

It is a version of our code. Branches have a name and are pointing to a commit (there's a different history+past commits depending on our branch, but some commits may be common).
<br>
One branche per feature (the smaller the better) so changes happen to the branch, not the master workflow until the final merge. Afterwards, we merge and delete the branch.

## Commands

- `git branch <name>` = creates the branch, it's an exact duplicate of our current/previous branch (they point to the same commit)
- `git branch` = returns my current branch
- `git checkout <name>` = changes current (`HEAD`), `<name>` points to `HEAD` now
- `git branch -d <name>` = deletes this branch (**NOT** the commits also)
- `git checkout -b <name>` = creates a new branch and makes this new branch as our current working one = `git branch <name>` + `git checkout <name>`
- `git merge <branch>` = merges <branch>'s history with my current branch + try to merge changes in files from both the branches => 2 parents in new commit. _(Afterwards we find the most recent parent of those two parents => commits of the new branch = commits of parent1 + commits of parent2 => updates master, master in new commit - see schema (1))_

_schema (1)_
![branch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19435096/66163182-62b38500-e638-11e9-96a8-bc81d9ca43a4.jpg)

_Note: If you make a branch on terminal and want it to show on GitHub, you need to `git push origin branchname` first!_
_Note2: After being done with a branch, `git checkout <productionbranch>`, and then `git merge <tesbranch>` and then `git branch -d <testbranch>` (you can delete the testbranch from GitHub's UX)_

### Master Branch

- Our default branch after a `git init` command.
- (For most projects) it has a 'current' code
- Usually we create a new branch as a copy of master

## References to parental nodes

| Symbol | Meaning                                                    |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| ~      | 1 commit behind                                            |
| ^      | the first commited parent                                  |
| ~2     | commit's grandpa (2 commits back based on `^` (if merged)) |
| ^2     | second parent from merge                                   |

e.g. `192a812~2` = 2 commits before commit #192a812, or `HEAD^2`

## Rewriting History

We can change our commits' sequence, description and changes, but: **you should not rewrite a history in commits that others may pull** <br>
`git commit --amend` = changes most recent commit, add to it the staged stuff.<br>
`git commit --amend --no-edit` = [check here](https://dev.to/lt0mm/comment/eo8)

## Back Merging

When I work on a branch, it is possible that some changes might have happened on master => we need `git merge master` and resolve the conflicts. Or...

- `git rebase` = like `merge` but better, it happens between two branches and changes the base where a branch has been made, rewrites its history (clean). Followed by a clean `pull request`. Generally we merge only for final pull request on each branch.
- `git rebase -i` = dynamic: changes the sequence of commit applies changes, fixes multiple commits or can break a commit to many.
- `git reset <commit>` (usually `git reset HEAD`) = returns current branchto <commit>, cancels in between changes.

**Not for published commits!!**

- `git push --force-with-lease` or `git push --force` = if I change history, git denies pushing w/o it.
